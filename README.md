- 👋 Hi, I’m @DhruvMaroo
- 👀 I’m interested in computer security, ethical hacking, reverse engineering, networking, logic, problem solving, and desktop app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of hacking and computer security, along with programming languages like C, C++ and Python. I am also learning to use GTK+3 and gtkmm to develop desktop apps, specifically focused on Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer security, making already written code less vulnerable, thus making that application more secure.
- 📫 You can reach out to me at my email: dhruvmaru007@gmail.com
